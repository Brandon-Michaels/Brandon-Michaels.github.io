  We study algorithmic tradeoffs in transitioning from snapshot-based to
  event-based resilience metrics for power grid analysis. By formalizing event
  detection and aggregation under realistic grid dynamics, we characterize how
  design choices impact sensitivity, stability, and interpretability of
  resilience estimates.
